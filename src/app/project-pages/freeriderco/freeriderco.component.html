                From instagram branding to email campaigns, I bring motion to the brand
                photography through playful gifs. Creating brand stickers that can be
                used on instagram, which through <a href = "https://giphy.com/FreeriderCo/" id = "link">GIPHY</a>, have reached over 1.5 million views.
